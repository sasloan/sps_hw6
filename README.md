CIS 2110
Homework Assignment #6

Learning Objectives: 
 To demonstrate the student's ability to process decisions in Python 
Assignment:
 For this homework, you will write 4 programs.  YOU WILL TURN IN ONLY ONE 
FILE- but it should contain all of the programs. When I run your code, the programs 
should execute one after the next.  Program 1 should be first, program 2 should be 
second, etc.  
 These programs are all based on skills you should be learning in chapters 1, 2, and 3 of 
the “Python for Everyone” textbook.  
Program 1
Write a program that reads an integer value and prints to the user whether that value is 
negative, zero, or positive.  The wording you use to prompt the user for input and give feedback 
to the user are up to you, but the instructions should be self-explanatory and the output should be 
clear.  It doesn’t have to be fancy- but it needs to be clear and work!
Program 2  (I suggest you review section 2.2 of “Python for Everyone” before you start this 
program)
Pretend you work at a bank.  You want to write a program that will make change quickly and 
easily.  Write a program that accepts a dollar value (including 2 decimal places) that is less than 
$10,000.  Assume your bank cashiers have bills in increments of $20, $10, $5, and $1, and also 
quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies.  Write a program that tells you how many of each kind of 
paper bills and coins to give exact change with the minimum number of bills and coins.  
Eg:  if I input $19.67 cents, I should get an output like:
We suggest the following:
1 - $10 bill
1 - $5 bill
4 - $1 bills
2 – quarters
1 – dime
1 – nickel 
2 - pennies
Program 3
Write a program that reads in a string and prints whether it
Contains only letters
Contains only uppercase letters
Contains only lowercase letters
Contains only digits
Contains only letters or digits
Starts with an uppercase letter*
Ends with a period
(Hint- review sections 2.4 and 3.8 of “Python for Everyone”)
*review 2.4 to see how to get the first letter.  See 3.8 to see how to test for uppercase.
Program 4
The original U.S. income tax of 1913 was quite simple.  The tax was:
1% on the first $50,000
2% on the amount over $50,000 up to $75,000
3% on the amount over $75,000 up to $100,000
4% on the amount over $100,000 up to $250,000
5% on the amount over $250,000 up to 500,000
6% on the amount over $500,000
Write a Python program that asks an individual for their income, and then computes the income 
tax according to this schedule.   
For example:
Please enter your income:  275000.00
The amount of income tax you owe is:  9000.00
